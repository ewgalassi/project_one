# Tender

This app is a restaurant finder for indecisive people with an appetite.  By putting in the criteria for the type of cuisine, price range, Google rating, and distance to travel a user can find the top choices to match their preferences.  The result will be a random restaurant from the list of results.  This way the user has the choice made for them, but can still dismiss the first result and choose another.
